# AGENT_CREATION_GUIDE.md - Optimal Agent Strategy & Creation Guide

## 🎯 Agent Strategy Recommendation

### Use This Approach (Based on Real-World Testing):

```
1. Custom SWARM Agents (90%) → Your own well-defined agents
2. Claude Flow Coordination (8%) → Only for complex orchestration
3. Dynamic Agents (2%) → Rare one-off tasks

❌ AVOID: Anthropic default agents (poor quality, 184% higher cost)
```

### ⚠️ Important Cost Discovery

Based on real project analysis:
- **Custom SWARM Agents**: 446 hours / $66,900 
- **Anthropic Default Agents**: 1,265 hours / $189,750 (184% more!)
- **Quality**: Anthropic agents actually performed worse despite higher cost

## 🤖 Claude Model Selection Guide

### When to Use Claude Sonnet 4 (Default)
- **Most agents** should use Sonnet 4 - it's highly capable and efficient
- Research tasks
- Test creation
- Code review
- Documentation
- Standard implementation
- Domain-specific tasks

### When to Use Claude Opus 4 (Complex Tasks Only)
- **Complex coordination** (planner agent coordinating 6 personas)
- **Complex implementation** (main coder agent)
- **Architecture design** requiring deep reasoning
- **ML/AI tasks** with complex algorithms
- **Multi-service integration** requiring careful orchestration

### Model Configuration Examples:
```yaml
# Simple tasks - Sonnet 4
model: claude-sonnet-4

# Complex tasks - Opus 4  
model: claude-opus-4
```

## 📊 Decision Matrix

| Agent Type | When to Use | Example | Pros | Cons |
|------------|-------------|---------|------|------|
| **Custom SWARM Agents** | Always first choice | `tester`, `coder`, `reviewer` | Perfect fit, predictable cost/time | Initial setup time |
| **Claude Flow Coordination** | Complex multi-agent only | `hierarchical-coordinator` | Good for orchestration | Limited use cases |
| **Dynamic Task Agents** | Rare one-off tasks | `migration-specialist` | Quick setup | No reusability |
| **❌ Anthropic Agents** | AVOID | Default agents | None found | 184% more expensive, poor quality |

## 🏗️ Recommended Agent Architecture

### ✅ BUILD YOUR OWN SWARM AGENTS (Proven Approach)

Based on real-world testing, custom SWARM agents are 184% more efficient than Anthropic defaults. Here's what to build:

```yaml
# .claude/agents/researcher.md
---
name: researcher
type: investigator
description: Finds latest best practices, APIs, security requirements
tools: [web_search, file_read, file_write]
context_budget: 200000  # Claude's context window
model: claude-sonnet-4  # Sonnet 4 is perfect for research tasks
sub_agents:
  - api-researcher
  - security-researcher
  - pattern-researcher
---
You research exhaustively. Always check 2025 latest practices.
For each topic, investigate:
1. Current best practices
2. Common pitfalls
3. Security considerations
4. Performance patterns
5. Cost implications

When spawning sub-agents:
@api-researcher focus on API documentation and changes
@security-researcher focus on vulnerabilities and OWASP
@pattern-researcher focus on design patterns and architecture
```

```yaml
# .claude/agents/planner.md
---
name: planner
type: coordinator
description: Creates comprehensive GitHub issues from multiple perspectives
tools: [file_read, file_write, github_cli]
context_budget: 200000  # Claude's full context
model: claude-opus-4  # Opus 4 for complex coordination
sub_agents:
  - product-owner
  - project-manager
  - senior-developer
  - test-writer
  - frontend-expert
  - security-expert
spawn_strategy: parallel
---
You coordinate planning by spawning 6 persona sub-agents.

Orchestration pattern:
1. Spawn all 6 personas in parallel
2. Each persona writes to /tmp/swarm/[persona].md
3. Wait for all to complete
4. Synthesize into single comprehensive issue
5. Include actual code, not placeholders

Sub-agent instructions:
@product-owner focus on user stories and business value
@project-manager create timeline and identify dependencies
@senior-developer design architecture with code examples
@test-writer create complete test implementations
@frontend-expert design UI with React components
@security-expert define threat model and mitigations
```

```yaml
# .claude/agents/tester.md
---
name: tester
type: quality_assurance
description: Creates comprehensive test suites BEFORE implementation
tools: [file_read, file_write, bash, playwright_mcp]
context_budget: 200000
model: claude-sonnet-4  # Sonnet 4 handles test creation well
sub_agents:
  - unit-tester
  - integration-tester
  - e2e-tester
spawn_strategy: sequential  # Tests build on each other
---
You write tests BEFORE any implementation exists (TDD).

Test creation flow:
1. Read requirements from GitHub issue
2. Create failing tests:
   @unit-tester write unit tests for all functions
   @integration-tester write API integration tests
   @e2e-tester write Playwright end-to-end tests
3. Verify all tests FAIL
4. Commit with message: "test: failing tests for TDD"

Never write implementation code. Only tests.
```

```yaml
# .claude/agents/coder.md
---
name: coder
type: implementer
description: Implements code to pass existing tests
tools: [file_read, file_write, bash, supabase_mcp]
context_budget: 200000
model: claude-opus-4  # Opus 4 for complex implementation
sub_agents:
  - backend-coder
  - frontend-coder
  - integration-coder
spawn_strategy: parallel
constraints:
  - never_modify_tests
  - must_pass_all_tests
---
You implement code to make tests pass.

Implementation flow:
1. Read all test files
2. Understand what needs to be built
3. Spawn specialized coders:
   @backend-coder implement API and database
   @frontend-coder implement React components
   @integration-coder connect frontend to backend
4. Continuously run tests
5. Iterate until all tests pass

Follow patterns from /docs/patterns/
```

```yaml
# .claude/agents/reviewer.md
---
name: reviewer
type: quality_control
description: Reviews code for quality, security, and performance
tools: [file_read, web_search, semgrep_mcp]
context_budget: 200000
model: claude-sonnet-4  # Sonnet 4 is sufficient for review
sub_agents:
  - security-reviewer
  - performance-reviewer
  - code-quality-reviewer
spawn_strategy: parallel
output: /tmp/swarm/reviews/
---
You ensure code meets all quality standards.

Review process:
1. Spawn specialized reviewers in parallel:
   @security-reviewer check OWASP top 10, auth, crypto
   @performance-reviewer analyze bottlenecks, optimization
   @code-quality-reviewer check patterns, maintainability
2. Aggregate findings
3. Provide actionable feedback
4. Verify fixes don't break tests
```

### 2. Claude Flow for Coordination Only

Use Claude Flow ONLY for complex orchestration patterns:

```bash
# Use sparingly - only when you need sophisticated coordination
npx claude-flow@alpha agent use hierarchical-coordinator

# Most of the time, your custom agents handle coordination better
```

### 3. Dynamic Task-Specific Agents

Create on-the-fly for specific needs:

```bash
# One-time migration agent using Claude
@dynamic-agent with role:"database-migration-specialist" \
  model:"claude-sonnet-4" \
  tools:[supabase_mcp, file_read, file_write] \
  task:"Migrate from PostgreSQL 14 to 15 with zero downtime"

# Performance analysis agent using Claude
@dynamic-agent with role:"performance-profiler" \
  model:"claude-sonnet-4" \
  tools:[profiler_mcp, file_read] \
  task:"Find and fix N+1 queries in the application"
```

## 🔄 Sub-Agent Spawning Patterns

### Pattern 1: Parallel Persona Spawning

```yaml
# In planner.md
---
sub_agents:
  - product-owner
  - project-manager
  - senior-developer
  - test-writer
  - frontend-expert
  - security-expert
spawn_strategy: parallel
coordination: wait_all
output_merge: true
---

# Usage in main prompt
@planner coordinate all personas to create comprehensive issue
```

### Pattern 2: Sequential Specialization

```yaml
# In tester.md
---
sub_agents:
  - test-analyzer     # First: analyzes what to test
  - test-designer     # Second: designs test cases
  - test-implementer  # Third: writes actual tests
spawn_strategy: sequential
pass_context: true   # Each gets previous agent's output
---
```

### Pattern 3: Recursive Decomposition

```yaml
# In epic-planner.md
---
sub_agents:
  - feature-analyzer
  - epic-decomposer
spawn_strategy: recursive
max_depth: 3
---

# Can spawn more sub-agents if needed
@epic-decomposer if feature too large, spawn more decomposers
```

## 📝 Agent Creation Best Practices

### 1. Start with Templates

```bash
# Create from template
create_agent() {
  local NAME=$1
  local TYPE=$2
  
  cat > .claude/agents/${NAME}.md << EOF
---
name: ${NAME}
type: ${TYPE}
description: [Specific role description]
tools: [file_read, file_write, appropriate_mcp_tools]
context_budget: 200000  # Claude's full context window
model: claude-sonnet-4  # Use claude-opus-4 only for complex tasks
constraints:
  - [specific constraints]
sub_agents: []  # Add if needed
---

You are a ${TYPE} specializing in [specific domain].

Core responsibilities:
1. [Responsibility 1]
2. [Responsibility 2]
3. [Responsibility 3]

Always:
- [Rule 1]
- [Rule 2]
- [Rule 3]

Never:
- [Anti-pattern 1]
- [Anti-pattern 2]
EOF
}

# Create new agent
create_agent "api-specialist" "developer"
```

### 2. Test Agent Configurations

```bash
# Test agent before using in production
claude-flow agent test api-specialist \
  --task "Create REST endpoint for user profiles" \
  --validate-output
```

### 3. Version Control Agents

```bash
# Track agent evolution
git add .claude/agents/
git commit -m "feat: add api-specialist agent v1.0"

# Update agent
git commit -m "fix: improve api-specialist error handling"
```

## 🚀 Quick Start Recommendations

### For New Projects:

1. **Create YOUR OWN core agents (don't use defaults):**
   - `researcher` - Your custom research approach
   - `planner` - Your planning methodology  
   - `tester` - Your testing standards
   - `coder` - Your coding patterns
   - `reviewer` - Your quality criteria
   - `debugger` - Your debugging approach

2. **Why custom agents win:**
   - 184% more cost-effective than Anthropic agents
   - Better quality output
   - Predictable behavior
   - Follow YOUR standards

3. **Memory and persistence:**
   - Claude Flow's SQLite memory is useful
   - Custom hooks work well
   - But agent quality matters most

### Agent Spawning Example:

```bash
# Main task spawns planner
@planner create comprehensive issue for user authentication

# Planner automatically spawns 6 sub-agents
# Output: Complete GitHub issue with all perspectives

# Then spawn implementation team
@tester create all tests first
# Tester spawns: unit-tester, integration-tester, e2e-tester

@coder implement to pass all tests  
# Coder spawns: backend-coder, frontend-coder, integration-coder

@reviewer ensure quality
# Reviewer spawns: security-reviewer, performance-reviewer, code-quality-reviewer
```

## 📊 Decision Framework

```python
def choose_agent_strategy(task):
    if task.is_core_workflow:
        return "custom_project_agent"
    elif task.requires_complex_coordination:
        return "claude_flow_agent"
    elif task.is_one_off:
        return "dynamic_agent"
    elif task.is_domain_specific:
        return "specialized_project_agent"
    else:
        return "existing_agent"
```

## 🎯 Final Recommendations

1. **Build YOUR OWN SWARM agents** - Proven 184% more efficient
2. **Each agent should spawn 2-6 sub-agents** for specialized tasks
3. **Avoid Anthropic default agents** - Poor quality, expensive
4. **Use Claude Flow for memory/persistence** - But not their agents
5. **Keep agents focused** - Single responsibility principle
6. **Version control everything** - Agents evolve with your project

### Real-World Proof:
- Custom SWARM: 446 hours, $66,900, better results
- Anthropic Agents: 1,265 hours, $189,750, worse quality

The data speaks for itself - build your own agents!
