# Modular Designer Agent - Summary

## 🎯 What Was Created

### 1. **Modular Designer Agent** (`agents/modular-designer.md`)
A specialized agent that:
- Analyzes project structures for modular boundaries
- Detects when folders should become MCPs
- Generates concise README files optimized for AI
- Creates MCP server configurations automatically

### 2. **MCP Detection Script** (`scripts/detect-mcp-candidates.sh`)
Automated script that:
- Scans projects for MCP patterns
- Scores folders based on multiple criteria
- Optionally generates MCP configurations
- Provides visual feedback on candidates

### 3. **Module README Template** (`templates/MODULE_README_TEMPLATE.md`)
Template for generating AI-optimized documentation:
- Concise format (<200 lines)
- Clear API specifications
- Quick usage examples
- MCP interface details when applicable

### 4. **Example Documentation** (`examples/modular-design-example.md`)
Real-world example showing:
- LLM provider module structure
- MCP detection process
- Generated documentation
- MCP server implementation

## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Start
```bash
# Analyze project structure
@modular-designer analyze ./my-project

# Run detection script
./.claude/scripts/detect-mcp-candidates.sh

# Generate module documentation
@modular-designer create readme for ./modules/auth
```

### Common Patterns Detected
1. **Multiple Providers** (e.g., `llm_providers/` with openai/, anthropic/, etc.)
2. **Plugin Architecture** (e.g., `plugins/` with multiple implementations)
3. **Data Connectors** (e.g., `connectors/databases/` with postgres/, mysql/, etc.)
4. **Adapters/Handlers** (e.g., `adapters/` with similar interfaces)

### MCP Creation Criteria
- **3+ similar implementations** in a folder
- **Shared interface** or base class
- **Similar file structure** across implementations
- **Score ≥ 2/3** triggers MCP recommendation

## 📊 Integration with SWARM Workflow

The modular designer integrates seamlessly:
1. Use during **research phase** to understand project structure
2. Use during **planning phase** to define module boundaries
3. Use during **implementation** to ensure independence
4. Use during **review** to verify modular design

## 🔧 Key Features

### Automated Detection
- Scans for common modular patterns
- Calculates MCP suitability scores
- Identifies natural boundaries

### Documentation Generation
- Creates AI-optimized READMEs
- Focuses on essential information
- Includes usage examples and contracts

### MCP Server Creation
- Generates server configuration
- Creates schema definitions
- Provides implementation templates

## 📝 Updated Documentation

The following files were updated:
- `.claude/claude.md` - Added modular-designer to agent list
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added scripts and templates directories
- `.claude/DEVELOPER_CHEATSHEET.md` - Added module organization section

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Clear module boundaries improve maintainability
2. **AI-Friendly**: Documentation optimized for AI agent consumption
3. **Reusability**: MCPs can be shared across projects
4. **Parallel Development**: Independent modules enable parallel work
5. **Quality**: Enforces best practices for modular design
