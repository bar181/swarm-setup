## Key Documents

### 📚 Research Findings

### 🛠️ Implementation Guides
- **[planning-agent-implementation-guide.md](./planning-agent-implementation-guide.md)** - Detailed implementation strategy with architecture, prompts, and best practices

### 👥 Persona Library
- **[persona-prompts-library.md](./persona-prompts-library.md)** - Complete prompt templates for all 6 core personas plus specialized personas

### 🔄 Synthesis Algorithms
- **[synthesis-algorithms.md](./synthesis-algorithms.md)** - Detailed algorithms for combining multi-persona outputs into cohesive GitHub issues

## Key Insights

### 1. **Solo Performance Prompting (SPP) is Revolutionary**
- Instructs LLM to summon multiple personas working collaboratively
- Personas engage in active dialogue until consensus
- Combines knowledge-intensive and reasoning-intensive capabilities

### 2. **Parallel Execution is Critical**
- Always spawn all 6 personas simultaneously
- Each writes to designated output file
- Synthesis happens after all complete
- 70% faster than sequential approach

### 3. **Conflict Resolution Must Be Intelligent**
- Timeline conflicts: Use weighted average (PM has highest weight)
- Technical conflicts: Security requirements override all
- Priority conflicts: Scoring system based on multiple perspectives

### 4. **Real Code > Pseudocode**
- Every technical section must include actual, runnable code
- Test specifications include complete test implementations
- API designs show full endpoint implementations
- Database schemas include indexes and RLS policies

### 5. **Synthesis Requires Sophistication**
- Parse and structure each persona's output
- Identify and resolve conflicts systematically
- Merge complementary information
- Validate completeness before finalization

## Recommended Architecture

```yaml
Planning Agent (Claude Opus 4):
  Sub-Agents (Claude Sonnet 4):
    - product-owner: Business requirements
    - project-manager: Timeline and resources
    - senior-developer: Technical architecture
    - test-writer: Test specifications
    - frontend-expert: UI implementation
    - security-expert: Security requirements
  
  Process:
    1. Spawn all 6 personas in parallel
    2. Each writes to /tmp/swarm/[persona].md
    3. Wait for all completions
    4. Synthesize into comprehensive issue
    5. Validate and enhance if needed
    6. Create GitHub issue
```

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
- Spawn all personas in ONE message
- Provide complete context to each persona
- Include actual code implementations
- Use BDD format for acceptance criteria
- Apply 20% buffer to time estimates
- Store successful patterns for reuse

### ❌ DON'T:
- Spawn personas sequentially
- Accept vague requirements
- Use pseudocode or placeholders
- Skip security considerations
- Ignore conflicting perspectives
- Create incomplete issues

## Success Metrics

A well-synthesized planning output should achieve:
- **Completeness**: 95%+ (all sections populated)
- **Code Quality**: Includes 3+ substantial code blocks
- **Clarity Score**: >0.8 (clear, actionable content)
- **Consensus Level**: >0.7 (personas largely agree)
- **Execution Speed**: <5 seconds for synthesis

## Integration Points

This planning agent integrates with:
- **Research Phase**: Uses findings from research agent
- **Implementation Phase**: Provides specs for TDD flow
- **Memory System**: Stores patterns and decisions
- **GitHub Integration**: Creates issues via CLI

## Future Enhancements

1. **Machine Learning Integration**
   - Learn from successful issue patterns
   - Predict time estimates based on history
   - Auto-adjust persona weights

2. **Real-time Collaboration**
   - Allow personas to iterate on conflicts
   - Dynamic re-planning based on feedback
   - Live synthesis visualization

3. **Domain Specialization**
   - Industry-specific personas
   - Technology-specific templates
   - Compliance-aware planning

## Usage Example

```bash
# Research phase first
@researcher investigate user authentication best practices

# Then planning with all personas
@planner create comprehensive GitHub issue for user authentication feature

# Planner automatically:
# 1. Spawns 6 personas in parallel
# 2. Each provides their perspective
# 3. Synthesizes into complete issue
# 4. Creates GitHub issue #123
```

## Conclusion

This research provides a solid foundation for implementing a highly effective planning agent that:
- Leverages multiple expert perspectives
- Produces comprehensive, executable specifications
- Reduces ambiguity in requirements
- Accelerates development through clarity
- Ensures all aspects (business, technical, security) are considered

The combination of Solo Performance Prompting, parallel execution, and sophisticated synthesis creates planning outputs that serve as complete technical specifications, enabling faster and higher-quality implementation.
