# Multi-Persona Coordination Research for Planning Agent

## 1. Multi-Persona Coordination Patterns

### Solo Performance Prompting (SPP) - 2025 Innovation
- **Key Innovation**: Instruct LLM to summon multiple personas that work together collaboratively
- **Example**: For a software feature, generate: Product Owner, Architect, Developer, Tester, Security Expert
- **Process**: Personas engage in active dialogue until consensus is reached
- **Benefits**: 
  - Enhanced problem-solving for complex tasks
  - Combines knowledge-intensive and reasoning-intensive capabilities
  - Iterative collaboration generates accurate results through feedback

### Structured Role Assignment Pattern
- **Explicit Roles**: Each agent has well-defined responsibilities (leader/follower, domain specialization)
- **Role-Playing Framework**: CAMEL project uses "inception prompting" to maintain role consistency
- **Benefits**: Prevents role confusion, ensures complete task coverage
- **Implementation**: Each persona has backstory, goals, and constraints

### Emergent Role Discovery
- **Dynamic Specialization**: Agents discover roles through learning and specialization
- **ROMA Algorithm**: Role-Oriented Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
- **Real-Time Adaptation**: LLM-driven agents with game-theoretic reasoning
- **Nash Equilibrium**: Agents adapt policies in real-time to maintain equilibrium

### Coordination Mechanisms
1. **Scheduled to Unscheduled Meetings**: Transition patterns in large software programs
2. **Personal Modes**: Mutual adjustment between individuals
3. **Virtual Navigator Models**: Dynamic path adjustment and real-time optimization
4. **Stigmergy-Based**: Virtual pheromones guide agent movement

## 2. Agile Planning Methodologies (2025)

### GitHub Issues Best Practices
- **User Story Format**: "As a [user], I want [action], so that [outcome]"
- **Well-Formed Issues**: Include acceptance criteria and requirements
- **Issue Templates**: Standardized structure for consistency
- **AI Integration**: 65% of teams using AI tools by 2027

### Sprint Planning Evolution
- **Velocity-Based Planning**: Match story points to average velocity
- **GitHub Projects**: Live canvas for filtering, sorting, grouping issues
- **Iteration Fields**: Schedule work and create timelines
- **Automation**: Tools auto-schedule sprints based on velocity

### Executable Specifications
- **BDD Format**: Given/When/Then for acceptance criteria
- **Natural Language**: Understandable by technical and non-technical stakeholders
- **Automated Tests**: Requirements become executable validation
- **AI Enhancement**: Well-written acceptance tests improve AI-generated code

## 3. GitHub Issue Template Structure

### Comprehensive Issue Components
1. **Business Context** (Product Owner)
   - User stories with acceptance criteria
   - Success metrics (SMART)
   - Business value and ROI

2. **Project Planning** (Project Manager)
   - Timeline and milestones
   - Dependencies and blockers
   - Risk assessment matrix

3. **Technical Architecture** (Senior Developer)
   - System design diagrams
   - Implementation pseudocode
   - Actual code snippets
   - Database schema

4. **Test Specifications** (Test Writer)
   - Unit test examples
   - Integration test plans
   - E2E test scripts (Playwright)
   - Performance criteria

5. **Frontend Implementation** (Frontend Expert)
   - Component architecture
   - State management approach
   - Performance optimization

6. **Security Requirements** (Security Expert)
   - Threat model
   - Security implementation
   - OWASP compliance

## 4. Parallel Agent Coordination Techniques

### Distributed Intelligence Architecture
- **Task Distribution**: Break down and distribute among specialized agents
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple expert agents process simultaneously
- **MixtureOfAgents**: Feed tasks to multiple experts in parallel

### Master-Worker Pattern
- **Central Orchestrator**: Master agent manages workflow
- **Task Delegation**: Distributes to specialized sub-agents
- **Result Integration**: Combines outputs from workers
- **HierarchicalSwarm**: Director creates plans and distributes tasks

### Decentralized Coordination
- **No Central Controller**: Agents collaborate semi-independently
- **Emergent Behavior**: Collective intelligence from local interactions
- **Goal-Driven**: Each agent operates toward shared objectives

### Shared Memory Systems
- **Memory Types**: Vector DB, key-value store, graph database
- **Asynchronous Coordination**: Support cross-agent learning
- **Loose Coupling**: Agents interact through shared state

### Advanced Strategies
1. **Conflict Resolution**: Token-passing, probabilistic selection, bidding models
2. **Hybrid Swarm Intelligence**: ACO + PSO algorithms
3. **Feedback Loops**: Iterative improvement through cycles
4. **Communication Protocols**: Event-driven architectures

## 5. Planning Agent Prompting Strategies

### Multi-Agent Prompting Principles
1. **Define Clear Roles**: Each persona has specific expertise
2. **Set Focused Topics**: Provide clear discussion subjects
3. **Encourage Interaction**: Specify how personas collaborate
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Test and improve prompts

### Prompt Components for Planning
```yaml
Planning Agent Prompt Structure:
- Role Definition: "You coordinate planning by spawning 6 persona sub-agents"
- Orchestration Pattern:
  1. Spawn all personas in parallel
  2. Each writes to designated output
  3. Wait for completion
  4. Synthesize into comprehensive issue
- Sub-agent Instructions:
  - @product-owner: user stories, business value
  - @project-manager: timeline, dependencies
  - @senior-developer: architecture, code examples
  - @test-writer: complete test implementations
  - @frontend-expert: UI/React components
  - @security-expert: threat model, mitigations
```

### Best Practices
- **Dynamic Persona Generation**: Adapt personas based on task
- **Explicit Planning**: Make agents "think out loud"
- **Context Provision**: Ensure complete information
- **Simplicity**: Avoid over-complex prompts
- **Specificity**: Precise instructions over verbose ones

## 6. Output Synthesis Techniques

### Synthesis Patterns
1. **Consensus Building**: Personas dialogue until agreement
2. **Hierarchical Integration**: Master agent combines sub-agent outputs
3. **Template Merging**: Structured sections from each persona
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Voting or priority-based resolution

### Quality Assurance
- **Completeness Checks**: Ensure all perspectives covered
- **Consistency Validation**: Resolve contradictions
- **Format Standardization**: Unified output structure
- **Review Cycles**: Multiple passes for refinement

### GitHub Issue Generation
1. **Template Population**: Fill standardized sections
2. **Cross-Reference**: Link related issues and dependencies
3. **Metadata Addition**: Labels, milestones, assignments
4. **Validation**: Ensure executable specifications

## Key Insights for Implementation

1. **Parallel Execution**: Always spawn personas simultaneously for efficiency
2. **Clear Boundaries**: Each persona has distinct responsibilities
3. **Structured Output**: Use templates for consistent results
4. **Iterative Process**: Allow for refinement cycles
5. **Memory Integration**: Store and retrieve context across sessions
6. **Automated Validation**: Check completeness before finalization
