## Modern Debugging Methodologies

### The Evolution of Debugging in 2025

Modern debugging has evolved from intuition-based troubleshooting to a systematic, data-driven discipline. The key shift is toward:

- **Hypothesis-driven approaches** rather than random exploration
- **Automated debugging assistance** through AI and ML
- **Integrated observability** across the entire stack
- **Proactive debugging** through continuous monitoring

### Key Frameworks

## Scientific Debugging Approach

### The Scientific Method Applied to Debugging

The scientific method transforms debugging from a haphazard process into a structured discipline:

1. **Observation**: Document the bug's symptoms precisely
2. **Hypothesis Formation**: Create falsifiable explanations
3. **Experimentation**: Design controlled tests
4. **Data Collection**: Gather evidence systematically
5. **Analysis**: Draw conclusions based on evidence
6. **Iteration**: Refine hypotheses based on results

### Implementation Steps

```markdown
1. Reliably reproduce the failure
2. Simplify to minimal test case
3. Form specific, testable hypotheses
4. Design experiments to validate/invalidate
5. Document findings and iterate
```
